# Telegram Bot

This repository contains a Telegram bot designed to automate tasks, provide information, or interact with users based on predefined logic. The bot is built using Python and leverages the Telegram Bot API.

## Features

- **Automated Responses**: Responds to user queries with predefined answers.
- **Task Automation**: Executes specific tasks such as reminders, notifications, or data retrieval.
- **Custom Commands**: Supports custom commands for enhanced functionality.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to add new features or integrations.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that initializes and runs the bot.
- `.env`: Stores sensitive information like the bot token and API keys.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `utils/`: Contains utility scripts for handling specific tasks or logic.
- `handlers/`: Contains the command and message handlers for the bot.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A Telegram bot token obtained from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

---

## How It Works

- The bot listens for incoming messages or commands from users.
- Based on the input, it executes the corresponding handler logic.
- The bot responds to the user or performs the desired action.

---

## Security

- Ensure your `.env` file is not exposed publicly.
- Use secure tokens and API keys.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more advanced features like natural language processing.
- Integrate with external APIs for dynamic data retrieval.
- Implement a database for storing user data or bot state.
